    "# Understanding the Multi-Plane Fermat Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up multi_plane and multi_plane_base\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, when `multi-plane` is set to true in the lens model, `multi_plane_base` is also initialised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the redshift at which the interpolation over the lens planes stops, if not yet specified, is set to be the redshift of the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the `self._cosmo_bkg` class instance is initialised. This is the `Background` class from *Cosmo*, initialised as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`self._cosmo_bkg = Background(cosmo, interp=cosmo_interp, z_stop=z_interp_stop, num_interp=num_z_interp)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This class computes cosmological distances using `cosmo_interp`, a class which interpolates the comoving transverse distances and then calculates angular diameter distances from this\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then double-checks that the maximum redshift in the list of lens redshifts isn't greater than the redshift taken to be the source redshift\n",
    "\n",
    "We then check that the number of lens models we have matches the number of redshift values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no lens models, the ordered list of redshift indices is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we create a list of indices of `lens_redshift_list`, ordered according to the redshifts they correspond to\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the code interpolates through the lens planes. To this end, the starting redshift is set to be zero, as is the starting value of `T_z`. Note\n",
    "\n",
    "`T_z` is the comoving transverse distance to redshift z as viewed from the observer\n",
    "`T_ij` is the comoving transverse distance to the plane with the redshift of the index being iterated through, as viewed from the redshift of the previous index\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also then populates a list of distance factors, but this isn't relevant for time delays\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then iterates through the sorted list of indices. If the lens being iterated through has the same redshift as the previous one, then the comoving transverse between them is 0, and `T_z` doesn't need to be updated. If not, then `T_z` and `T_ij` at this redshift are calculated and appended to the lists. The code then repeats through the next redshift index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Arrival Time\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `arrival_time` function is called, this basically just calls `geo_shapiro_time_delay`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dt_geo, dt_grav = self.geo_shapiro_delay(theta_x, theta_y, kwargs_lens, check_convention=check_convention)`\n",
    "\n",
    "which returns `dt_geo, dt_grav`, which are then added together to give the arrival time\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Shapiro Time Delay\n",
    "\n",
    "### the setup\n",
    "\n",
    "`geo_shapiro_time_delay` works as follows. Firstly, the arrays are set up. These are arrays with as many values as there are images which are being considered, and their values will be updated with each step in the interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "`dt_grav = np.zeros_like(theta_x, dtype=float)\n",
    "dt_geo = np.zeros_like(theta_x, dtype=float)\n",
    "x = np.zeros_like(theta_x, dtype=float)\n",
    "y = np.zeros_like(theta_y, dtype=float)\n",
    "alpha_x = np.array(theta_x, dtype=float)\n",
    "alpha_y = np.array(theta_y, dtype=float)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`dt_grav` is, of course, the total gravitational time delay, while `dt_geo` is the geometric time delay. For each successive lens plane, the time delay for that component of the light beam's path is calculated, and these are added together to give the totals\n",
    "\n",
    "`x` and `y` are the physical positions at which the light beam intersects the lens plane. These are updated using the deflection angles of each lens as we iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "`alpha_x` and `alpha_y` are the deflection angles, which allow us to determine the position of the beam in a certain plane from the source. Initially, these are simply set to be `theta_x` and `theta_y` (**come back to why**)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then iterate through each of the lens planes, starting with the observer plane (where i = 0). We also set \n",
    "\n",
    "`z_lens_last = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is treated as the redshift of the previous lens, and is updated with each successive iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop then begins, looping through i = 0,1,2,3,..., and the sorted list of redshift indices (which could be any order of indices, but ensures that these indices correspond to lenses ranked in increasing order of redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### the for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `z_lens = self._lens_redshift_list[index]`, i.e. `z_lens` is defined to be the redshift of that lens\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `if z_lens <= z_stop:`, i.e. check that the redshift at which we stop iterating (that of the source) hasn't been reached\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `T_ij = self._T_ij_list[i]`. Recall that the list of `T_ij` values,  determined when multi_plane was first initialised, is already in order of increasing redshift, and so here we use `i` instead of `index` to find the value. This step sets `T_ij` to be the value appropriate for this plane, which is the tranverse comoving distance from the previous plane to the current one. This value will be replaced for each step of the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `x_new, y_new = self._ray_step(x, y, alpha_x, alpha_y, T_ij)`. Here, we use the `_ray_step` function in `multi_plane_base` (see more below). This updates the position at which quantities are evaluated in the lens plane\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `if i == 0: pass`. This step ensures that values of the tranverse comoving distances and geometrical time delays need not be calculated when the lens in question is the first lens. To understand this, think about the fact that the geometric term is calculated in terms of the difference between the lens plane and source plane positions, and not to do with the observer to image plane differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. `elif T_ij > 0:` This step ensures that we do not calculate the geometric time delay for that iteration if the lens plane is at the same redshift as the previous one \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "8. `dt_grav_new = self._gravitational_delay(x, y, kwargs_lens, i, z_lens)` the gravitational time delay doesn't need `T_ij > 0`. This is because multiple lenses in the same plane will each contribute separately to the gravitational time delay. This step returns the gravitational time delay (see below for how)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `alpha_x, alpha_y = self._add_deflection(x, y, alpha_x, alpha_y, kwargs_lens, i)` the overall deflection angle is updated by adding the deflection angle caused by that specific lens (see below)\n",

    "The above for loop will of course only go up the final lens, which is not the same as all the way to the source plane. We therefore need to account for the additional geometrical time delay (there is no gravitational time delay due to the source plane.\n",
